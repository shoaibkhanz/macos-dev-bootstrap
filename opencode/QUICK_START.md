## 🔧 Customisation Tips

### Personalise Your Workflow

1. **Morning template**: Create a template in your daily note for consistent structure
2. **Tag system**: The agent learns from your existing tags - keep them consistent
3. **Linking habits**: Agent suggests links - accept them to build your knowledge graph
4. **Blog voice**: After a few blogs, the agent learns your style

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn these OpenCode shortcuts:
- `Tab` - Switch between agents
- `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` - Scroll chat (Vim-style, from your config)
- `Ctrl+P` - Command palette

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What the Agent Does
✅ Appends to existing daily notes (created by Obsidian plugin)  
✅ Creates new notes in correct folders  
✅ Uses British English exclusively  
✅ Links to related notes proactively  
✅ Suggests relevant tags  

### What the Agent Doesn't Do
❌ Create daily notes (Obsidian plugin does this)  
❌ Modify existing content without permission  
❌ Use bash commands (disabled for safety)  
❌ Edit .obsidian/ folder  
❌ Use American English spelling  

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Agent not found"
**Fix**: Press `Tab` to cycle to obsidian agent, or restart OpenCode

### Issue: "Daily note doesn't exist"
**Fix**: 
1. Open Obsidian first to let plugin create today's note
2. Or manually create `DailyNotes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Issue: "Skill not loading"
**Fix**: Check `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` has skill permissions

### Issue: American spelling appears
**Fix**: This is a bug - report it. All content should be British English

### Issue: Links not working
**Fix**: Ensure note titles match exactly (case-sensitive)
